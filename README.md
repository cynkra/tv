# tv: Automatically show useful representations of objects in Browser (or Viewer, in RStudio)

### Ideas

- Complement, don't subsitute: tv shoud never change the look and feel of the console. Browser delay after console print.

- large or other borderline cases should never delay the workflow, tv should compress the object to make it tv approved

- Focus on dfs, but maybe also support other other objects (matrices, time series?)


### Todo

- [ ] disable non-interactively
- [ ] easyly copy paste col names (that is a killer problem in tibbles that we should solve)
